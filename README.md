# burger-2

This is a single-page node express app using MYSQL as a database with express handlebars being used to serve as the HTML page. After running the server through the terminal the app is routed through the browser where you will see this page:

You will input text (a type of burger) into the inbox and create a numbered list of burgers that are to be eaten. With a click event on any of the listed burgers they will be shifted to the right column of the page indicating they have been eaten. These events will automatically be logged into the MYSQL database.
